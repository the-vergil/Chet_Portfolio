      <description>It is a NLP project in which I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to find the relationship among different characters of a book with the help of natural language processing
Firstly the name of the characters are scraped from https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki with the help of Selenium so that we can separate the name of the characters from the other text data of the book
Then with the help of spacy we find the relationships among the characters and then with the help of networkx we have created network graphs that shows the relationship among the characters</description>
